                            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and
                            lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript
                            can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
                            them.



                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a
                            core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements.
                            Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
                            additional objects; for example:</p>

                        <p class="text-justify">Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a
                            browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow
                            an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as
                            mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to
                            running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application
                            to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
                            another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
