                            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and
                            lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript
                            can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
                            them.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date,
                            and Math, and a
                            core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements.
                            Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
                            additional objects; for example:</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to
                            control a
                            browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow
                            an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as
                            mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to
                            running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application
                            to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
                            another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.

                            <h2>JavaScript and Java</h2>
                        </header>
                        <p>
                            JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The
                            JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type
                            checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic
                            control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
                            JavaScript.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript
                            supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric,
                            Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the
                            more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
                            inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also
                            supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties
                            of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all
                            variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are
                            public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
                            parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

                        <p>
                            You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables,
                            called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($);
                            subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive,
                            letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through
                            "z" (lowercase).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use
                            the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
                            Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

                        <p>
                            You can declare a variable in three ways:
                            With the keyword var. For example,
                        </p>
                        <div class="code-segment">
                            <code>var x = 42.
                            </code>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.

                            By simply assigning it a value. For example,
                        </p>
                        <div class="code-segment">
                            <code>x = 42.
                            </code>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You
                            shouldn't use this variant.

                            With the keyword let. For example,
                        </p>

                        <div class="code-segment">
                            <code> let y = 13.
                            </code>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because
                            it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable
                            within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that
                            function.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable
                            declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides
                            within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function
                            (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if
                            statement.
                        </p>
                        <div class="code-segment">
                            <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5
                            </code>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.
                        </p>
                        <div class="code-segment">

                            Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object
                            is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.


                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another
                            window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called
                            phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as
                            parent.phoneNumber.

                        <p>
                            You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant
                            identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore
                            or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
                        </p>

                        <code>const PI = 3.14;
                        </code>
                        <p>
                            A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is
                            running. It has to be initialized to a value.

                            The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the
                            const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same
                            scope. For example:


                        </p>
                        <div class="code-segment">
                            <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
                                CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
                                }</code>
                        </div>
                        <p>However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without
                            problems.
                        </p>
                        <div class="code-segment">
                            <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";
                            </code>

                            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and
                            lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript
                            can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
                            them.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date,
                            and Math, and a
                            core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements.
                            Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
                            additional objects; for example:</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to
                            control a
                            browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow
                            an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as
                            mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to
                            running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application
                            to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
                            another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.

                        <p>
                            JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The
                            JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type
                            checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic
                            control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
                            JavaScript.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript
                            supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric,
                            Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the
                            more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
                            inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also
                            supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties
                            of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all
                            variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are
                            public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
                            parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

                        <p>
                            You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables,
                            called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($);
                            subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive,
                            letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through
                            "z" (lowercase).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use
                            the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
                            Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

                        <p>
                            You can declare a variable in three ways:
                            With the keyword var. For example,
                        </p>
                        <div class="code-segment">
                            <code>var x = 42.
                            </code>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.

                            By simply assigning it a value. For example,

                            This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You
                            shouldn't use this variant.

                            With the keyword let. For example,
                        </p>

                        <div class="code-segment">
                            <code> let y = 13.

                            This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.

                            When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because
                            it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable
                            within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that
                            function.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable
                            declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides
                            within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function
                            (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if
                            statement.
                        </p>
                        <div class="code-segment">

                        </div>
                        <p>
                            This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.

                            Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object
                            is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.


                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another
                            window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called
                            phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as
                            parent.phoneNumber.

                        <p>
                            You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant
                            identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore
                            or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
                        </p>

                        <code>const PI = 3.14;
                        </code>
                        <p>
                            A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is
                            running. It has to be initialized to a value.

                            The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the
                            const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same
                            scope. For example:


                        </p>
                        <div class="code-segment">
                            <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
                                CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
                                }</code>
                        </div>
